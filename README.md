# Face-Recognisation
Face Recognition Using OpenCV

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect human faces in an image. The program processes an input image by converting it to grayscale, detecting faces, and marking them with bounding boxes. This is a fundamental implementation of face recognition using computer vision techniques.

ðŸš€ Features
1. Uses OpenCVâ€™s haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml for face detection.
2. Reads and processes input images of various formats.
3. Converts images to grayscale for better feature extraction.
4. Detects multiple faces in an image.
5. Draws rectangles around detected faces.
